<h1># Customer Churn Prediction </h1>



<h2>Description</h2>
This project is focused on predicting customer churn using a machine learning model trained on historical customer data. The goal is to help businesses identify customers who are likely to leave, so they can take action in advance to retain them. The project uses Python, pandas, scikit-learn, and visualisation libraries like Seaborn and Matplotlib.
 <br />
 
<h2>Project Goal</h2>
  
The main goal is to build a predictive model that can accurately classify customers as either likely to churn[leave] or stay, based on their data and behaviour patterns..


<h2>üîç Approach & Methodology</h2>
  
The project follows these steps:  

</b>1Ô∏è‚É£. Data Loading & Cleaning ‚Äì Load the dataset, remove unnecessary columns, and check for missing values.

2Ô∏è‚É£. Feature Selection ‚Äì Define the target variable (churn) and remove irrelevant columns like id.

3Ô∏è‚É£. Splitting the Data ‚Äì Use an 80/20 split for training and testing the model.

4Ô∏è‚É£. Model Training ‚Äì Train a Random Forest Classifier on the training data.

5Ô∏è‚É£. Prediction & Evaluation ‚Äì Predict churn on the test set and evaluate results using accuracy, precision, recall, and F1 score.

6Ô∏è‚É£. Performance Summary ‚Äì Understand what the model's metrics mean and suggest areas for improvement. </b> 

<h2>Evaluation Metrics Explained</h2>
 <b>Accuracy ‚Äì Overall correctness of the model.

Precision ‚Äì Focuses on how many of the customers predicted to churn actually did.

Recall ‚Äì Measures how well we caught the true churners.

F1 Score ‚Äì Combines precision and recall for a balanced view.</b>
